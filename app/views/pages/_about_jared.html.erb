		<p class="bios card-panel">With my experience in starting and running businesses, I know how vital management and administration activities are. Whether you are a large company with teams for each process important to your bottom line, or a small business owner wearing multiple hats, the internet can reduce or streamline much of your admin efforts and costs. My pledge is to have your website or web app work at least as hard as you do and the good news is that it can! It never sleeps! With some automation of repetitive tasks, your world can have greater peace for the things that matter most.</p>
