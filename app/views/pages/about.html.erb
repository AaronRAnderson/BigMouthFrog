		<h2>Jared Lund</h2>
		<h4>Project Manager</h4>
		<p>With my experience in starting and running businesses I discovered how vital it management and administration activities are. Whether you are a large company with teams for each process important to your bottom line, or if you are a small business wearing multiple hats the world wide web can be your friend and can reduce or streamline much of your admin (aka overhead) efforts and costs. My pledge it to have your website or web app work at least as hard as you do - good news is that it can! It never sleeps and with some automation of repetitive tasks your world can have greater peace for the things that matter most.</p>
